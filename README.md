# Shard

This project was a school project based on C#. The goal was to create a real time strategy game. 
<br>
The project was based on 6 versions with the teacher pushing each week / 2 weeks a new version with new tests. Each week we needed to code so that we could pass all the tests and score the max grade. 

## About the Game 

The real time strategy game universe is in space, with a planet system of different sizes and ressources, ships, building, a chat, etc. The universe is semi random with a seed.
